This field in the Map page can be used to specify the number of connections the app retrieves in the field during a query. The default is 2. This means that any Agent or Target shown in the map will not be separated from the Agent queried by more than 2 connections. However, this can be changed by entering a different number. Because of the high interconnectivity of the map, the higher the number entered, the more complex the map will be.
