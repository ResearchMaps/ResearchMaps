Defines the type of experiment being mapped. In a positive manipulation (designated by an upward arrow), the levels/probability of the Agent are increased. In a negative manipulation (designated by a downward arrow), the levels/probability of the Agent are decreased. In a Non-Intervention (designated by a crossed over zero) the agent is not manipulated, and the experiment is focused on tracking the covariance of the agent and target. The observed change in the Agent can be either positive (designated by a crossed-over zero and an upward arrow) or negative (designated by a crossed-over zero and an downward arrow). This information must be filled in since this is critical to define the entity being mapped.
