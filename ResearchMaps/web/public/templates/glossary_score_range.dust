This field in the Map page can be used for visualizing only connections in the database that have a certain score range. There are a Minimum and Maximum fields under Score Range, where a number between 0 and 1 can be entered. For example, entering 0.125 in the Minimum field and 0.250 in the Maximum field would only show connections whose scores or weights are between these two values.
