Connects two different entities in the map. An edge can represent an excitatory connection (e.g., more of A leads to more of B; sharp arrow), inhibitory connection (e.g., more of A leads to less of B; blunt arrow) or no connection at all (more of A leads to no change in B; dashed line). Right clicking on the any edge allows the users to Edit (useful to correct wrong entries), Duplicate (useful when entering a series of related experiments) or Delete experiments entered by the user.
