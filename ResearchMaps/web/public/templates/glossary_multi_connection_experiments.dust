In this type of experiment there are at least two simultaneous manipulations of two separate Agents, and the effects are measured on a common Target. The goal of these experiments is to test whether one of the agents mediated the effects between the other agent and the target in an “A to B to C”, where A and B are the two manipulated agents and C is the target.
