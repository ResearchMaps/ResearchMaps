This field is used to record the change in the Target recorded during the experiment. An upward arrow is used to record increases in the Target, a downwards arrow records decreases and “No Change” is chosen when the target does not change during the experiment. For double-intervention experiments, the Results field has two additional choices: if the result of the double manipulation experiment is more pronounced than the change in the single manipulation experiment, than the user should choose either the double up (increases in the target) or down (decreases in the target) arrows. This information must be filled in since this is critical to define the entity being mapped.
